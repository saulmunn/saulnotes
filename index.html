          <p>
            No new note knows well its place,<br>
            before it settles softly.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/03/21/on-green">Green</a> and <a href="https://www.narrativeark.xyz/p/green-and-golden">golden</a> summers,<br>
            give rise to reddish vines;<br>
            blued and whited winters,<br>
            no longer feel aligned.<br>
            <br>
            These pages bleed with visions,<br>
            of wonderous hills behind.<br>
            Of gold and cherry countertops,<br>
            topped with ros√© wines.<br>
            <br>
            My thoughts began to splinter,<br>
            and flitter,<br> <!--add a flittering effect here-->
            and flicker,<br> <!--add a flickering effect here-->
            <br>
            and coalesce.<br> <!--as they scroll, add an effect that causes the text to coalesce-->
            and attune.<br> <!--make the text come together-->
            and resonate.<br>
            <br>
            No note knows not well its place,<br>
            not new nor known, not now.<br>
            None will settle softly;<br>
            none will settle softly.<br>
            <br>
            No page will <i>ever</i> settle.<br>
            Never softly, hardly hardly.<br>

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Saul. You can read about who I am
          <a href="https://saulmunn.com/">here</a>, read my more-polished
          writing <a href="https://brasstacks.blog/">here</a>, or read my
          less-polished notes... well, <i>here</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this notebook, I drew inspiration from the notebooks of
          <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/">Michael Neilsen</a>,
          <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes"
            >Andy Matuschak</a
          >, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/">David MacIver</a>. If
          this notebook brings a tenth as joy to someone's life as any of theirs
          has to mine, I'll be thrilled. And a little worried for their sanity,
          but mostly thrilled. (I'd also love to
          <a href="https://saulmunn.com/contact">meet</a> them!)
        </p>
        <p>
          In keeping with Andy Matuschak's tradition, there isn't a way to
          browse all of the links on this site. You'll need to discover them
          naturally, perhaps by recieving a link sent directly to you, or perhaps by following a trail of hyperlinks.
