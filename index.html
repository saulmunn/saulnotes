        <p>
          Hi, I'm Saul.  You can read about who I am <a href="https://saulmunn.com/">here</a>, read my more-polished writing <a href="https://brasstacks.blog/">here</a>, or read my less-polished notes... well, <i>here</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this notebook, I drew inspiration from the notebooks of <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/">Michael Neilsen</a>, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes">Andy Matuschak</a>, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/">David MacIver</a>. If this notebook is a tenth as valuable to someone as theirs has been to me, I'll be thrilled. And a little worried for their sanity, but mostly thrilled. (I'd also love to <a href="https://saulmunn.com/contact">meet</a> them!)
