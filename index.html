          Hi. I'm Saul.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can read about who I am
          <a href="https://saulmunn.com/">here</a>, read my more-polished
          writing <a href="https://brasstacks.blog/">here</a>, or read my
          less-polished notes... well, <i>here</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I drew inspiration from the notebooks of e.g.
          <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/">Michael Neilsen</a>,
          <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes"
            >Andy Matuschak</a
          >, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/">David MacIver</a>. 
In keeping with Andy Matuschak's tradition, there isn't a way to
          browse all of the links on this site; this is intentional. You'll need to discover them
          naturally, perhaps by a link sent directly to you, or perhaps by following a trail of hyperlinks.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start by reading <a href="/opening-poem.html">a poem</a> on the frame through which I view the development of notes on this site, or [TODO: insert more].
