            No new note knows well its place,<br />
            before it settles softly.<br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/03/21/on-green">Green</a> and
            <a href="https://www.narrativeark.xyz/p/green-and-golden">golden</a>
            summers,<br />
            give rise to reddish vines;<br />
            blued and whited winters,<br />
            no longer feel aligned.<br />
            <br />
            These pages bleed with visions,<br />
            of wonderous hills behind.<br />
            Of gold and cherry countertops,<br />
            topped with ros√© wines.<br />
            <br />
            My thoughts began to splinter,<br />
            and flitter,<br />
            <!--add a flittering effect here-->
            and flicker,<br />
            <!--add a flickering effect here-->
            <br />
            and coalesce.<br />
            <!--as they scroll, add an effect that causes the text to coalesce-->
            and attune.<br />
            <!--make the text come together-->
            and resonate.<br />
            <br />
            No note knows not well its place,<br />
            not new nor known, not now.<br />
            None will settle softly;<br />
            none will settle softly.<br />
            <br />
            No page will <i>ever</i> settle.<br />
            Never softly, hardly hardly.<br />
